How to Run the code
click run all cells for part2.ipynb, and the dev.p2.out file will be generated in the following folder 
eg.EN(2)/dev.p2.out, ./SG(1)/dev.p2.out, ./CN/dev.p2.out.
To change the input files, they can be changed by changing the path of the file at the last cell before the ‘testing’ header and the very last cell in part2.ipynb.
